In this assignment I will generate 50 data points (one-dimensional problem) with x uniform distance from (0,1) with generating y from the formula y=sin(1+x^2)+noise.
Where noise has (0,0.032)distribution. Later, Dividing the data into training and test (8:2) and implementing
1) Linear regression models using the closed form solution on training data
2) Polynomial regression models using the closed form solution on training data

Finally, exploring their effectiveness in creating a predictor that best approximates the data using test data.
